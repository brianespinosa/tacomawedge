# Wedge Resources

We are located right in the heart of Tacoma and on the #1 Pierce Transit bus line. The T-Link light rail also runs adjacent to the Wedge. Restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, and the hospital are within walking distance, as the homes in the Wedge have a walk score in the 80s.

As it turns out, being central to everything has its perks. So we've kept a list of great resources, properly screened by some residents who have had great experiences with these people and places. Most are around the Wedge and some in the greater Tacoma area but worth the drive.
